EVENT REPORT PANEL-
    BUTTON- "View" displays true when no one is registered for the event and a commitee has been added.
	    "View" displays event_report.error when no one is registered for the event and a sub event has been added.

EVENT MANAGEMENT PANEL-
    Main event location not displayed on the Event Details.
    Furthermore, I did not find a way to intially set it to a value or edit it afterwards.

SUB EVENT DETAILS PANEL-
    "edit" button shows a pop-up window that is resizable. Not a bug per se but it allows the user to create a weird looking window.
    It has an empty JTextFieldArea that does not seem to do anything.
