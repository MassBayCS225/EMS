EVENT REPORT PANEL-
    BUTTON- "View" displays true when no one is registered for the event and a commitee has been added.
	    "View" displays event_report.error when no one is registered for the event and a sub event has been added.
	    "View" displays 1 when no one is registered for the event(don't not know why yet).

EVENT MANAGEMENT PANEL-
    Main event location not displayed on the Event Details.
    Furthermore, I did not find a way to intially set it to a value or edit it afterwards.

SUB EVENT DETAILS PANEL-
    1. "edit" button shows a pop-up window that is resizable. Not a bug per se but it allows the user to create a weird looking window.
    2. It has an empty JTextFieldArea that does not seem to do anything.
    3. If a sub event spans many days, it only shows its start date.
    4. If a user clicks on the Sub Event Details and there are no events, then clicks the "Edit Event" button, then clicks the save button,
         an exception is thrown. See Edit_Ghost_Sub_Event.exception.
    5. If a user clicks on the Sub Event Details and there are no events, then clicks the "Remove Event" button, then clicks the yes option,
         an exception is thrown. See Remove_Ghost_Sub_Event.exception.

USER MANAGEMENT PANEL-
    1. Admin may remove himself from being an admin, an action that can't be undone. It throws an exception. See Remove_Admin_Privileges.exception.
    2. A regular user after given administrator privileges can do the same as above as well as demoting the main admin to a regular user. See above.
