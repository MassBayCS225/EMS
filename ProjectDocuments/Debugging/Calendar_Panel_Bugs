Main event information not displayed on the calendar.

Rightmost column (Saturday) and bottom row(Sixth week) is smaller in size than all the other respective colums and rows.

ADD EVENT-
    BUTTON-
	"edit" button shows a pop-up window that is resizable. Not a bug per se but it allows the user to create a weird looking window.
	After editing main event, it's time is showing some extra decimals after seconds(milliseconds?).
    END TIME DROP DOWN MENU
	It allows for an event to end prior to a start time.

SUGGESTIONS-

1. Consider editing the edit button to restrict the options to only hours and minutes since the user must click on that calendar Day, Month and Year.
